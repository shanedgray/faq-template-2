				<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">Which recruitment challenges does Clinch address?</a>
				<div class="cd-faq-content">
					<p>Finding and hiring the right people can be difficult and time consuming even when you have a large budget. It’s even harder for early stage companies who are competing with established corporations for the top talent they need to grow their business.
						It get’s worse, most companies hire “reactively” by waiting until they have an open position. They use jobs boards, word of mouth and social media to try and find a candidate. With no employer brand and little online collateral available to answer …“Why would I want to work with you?”

						...applicants from the right candidates are slow to arrive. Desperate to fill positions, companies resort to expensive external recruiters. This increases costs and also results in candidate mismatches causing churn and disruption down the road.

						“Strong employer brands deliver a 50% lower cost per hire”

						Growing companies who use Clinch adopt a pro-active approach to hiring from the outset.  Using Clinch they create dynamic and engaging careers, team and about us pages to communicate everything that’s great about working for their company to prospective candidates. Even when they are not actively hiring they continually add to their candidate pool and build relationships with the future people they want to hire. Starting the conversation earlier makes the hiring process faster, easier and cheaper and  their strong employer brand increases staff engagement and reduces churn.

						“Candidates we attracted using Clinch were of a far higher standard” </p>
